      Here at Tailored Republic we are all about breaking the mold. People keep telling us that if we want to operate a
      tailored suit company that we need to move to New York or London. Well, we kind of like Los Angeles to tell you
      the truth.
    </p>
    <p>Just because we love wearing beautifully crafted suits doesn’t mean that we don’t also enjoy road trips
      to Vegas or basking in 80 degree November weather in a dog pile of sweaty, beautiful people at a live outdoor
      concert for a band that won’t tour in other cities until 2015. It is the perfect fit for the lifestyle that we
      want to live. And that’s what it comes down to, doesn’t it? Finding the perfect fit.
    </p>
    <p>At a certain point during the Tailored Republic process, it stops being about just buying a suit anymore. Things
      become about you. We realize that dressing well is not about being somebody you are not, it is about being the
      best version of you. From the lining to the number of buttons to the shape of the lapel, we want you to do you!
