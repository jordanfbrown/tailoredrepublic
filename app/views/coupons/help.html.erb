    <p>The Tailored Republic coupon system is built to be as flexible as possible. Because of this, creating a new
    coupon can be a little confusing. This guide explains the various options that are available when configuring
    new coupons. The following options are available:</p>
    <h6 class="bold">Description</h6>
    <p>The description is what will appear on the actual order (the review order page, the order confirmation email,
    and all of the admin screens for viewing orders). The description should be short and to the point: "Vest Discount",
    "Spring 10% Promotion", "Free Pocket Square", etc.</p>
    <h6 class="bold">Discount Type</h6>
    <p>There are two types of discount types: fixed and percentage. A fixed discount simply subtracts the amount from
    the total. A coupon with an "amount" of 50 and a discount type of "fixed" will subtract $50 from the total price. A
    coupon with an "amount" of 50 and discount type of "percentage" will subtract 50% from the total price.</p>
    <h6 class="bold">Amount</h6>
    <p>Used in conjunction with "discount type", this is the value of the coupon. For coupons with a coupon type of
    "gift card", this represents the total amount of money left on the gift card. Every time a gift card coupon is used,
    the total amount is decreased. Once the total amount reaches $0, the gift card can no longer be used. With a coupon
    of type "promotion", the amount does not decrease. For example, a $50 promotion with a quantity of 10 can be used
    10 times, and each time the total discount will be $50.</p>
    <h6 class="bold">Code</h6>
    <p>This corresponds to the coupon code that the user types in on the order form. For admin-generated coupons, this
    can be any value: "BIGJIM", "SHIRTSOFF", "POCKETSQUARES", etc. When a coupon is generated by the back-end for a gift
    card, the code is 8 randomly generated uppercase characters: "HSDFBSDP", "PQJFMWKL", etc.</p>
    <h6 class="bold">Coupon Type</h6>
    <p>There are two coupon types: gift card and promotion. The difference is that gift cards keep a running balance of
    the value that is remaining on the gift card. For example, if somebody has a $349 gift card coupon and purchases
    $100 worth of goods, the gift card's value will be reduced to $249. If somebody is using a promotion with a value of
    $349, the promotion will still be worth $349 after the purchase is completed. In almost all cases, you will be
    creating coupons of type "promotion." When a user purchases a gift card on the site, a new coupon of type "gift
    card" will be automatically created.</p>
    <h6 class="bold">Apply To</h6>
    <p>The apply to field determines which items in the order the coupon can be applied to. There are 5 possible
    options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Order:</strong> the coupon applies to the entire order. The cost of all the items are summed up and
      the discount is subtracted from this total.</li>
      <li><strong>Category:</strong> the coupon applies to items of a specific category. Currently there are three
      categories, and they must be typed exactly as follows: "suit", "shirt", and "accessory". A 50% promotion coupon
      applied to "shirt" would subtract 50% from the total price of all shirts in the order, and ignore all other items.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Subcategory:</strong> applies to items of a specific subcategory. Since subcategories can added
      dynamically via the <%= link_to 'product administration page', '/admin/products' %>, refer to that page to see the
      current list of subcategories. Examples as of writing this are: "pocket-square", "solids", "stripes", "gingham".
      </li>
      <li><strong>Product:</strong> the coupon applies only to a specific product. Good for running promotions on a
      single suit or shirt.</li>
      <li><strong>Customization:</strong> the coupon applies to a specific customization. Only two options are supported
      currently: "vest" and "pick_stitching". Good for running a promotion where we give a discount on adding a vest.
      As an example, a $40 promotion coupon applied to customizations of type "vest" would give the user $40 off a suit
      if a vest had been added.</li>
    </ul>
    <h6 class="bold">Quantity</h6>
    <p>Quantity represents the number of times a coupon can be used. The quantity of a coupon is decreased every time an
    order is successfully placed that uses the coupon. Once a coupon's quantity reaches 0, it can no longer be used.</p>
    <h6 class="bold">Max Items</h6>
    <p>The maximum number of items that the coupon can apply to. If you wanted to create a coupon that gave a $20
    discount on a pocket square, but wanted to ensure that the coupon could only be applied to 1 pocket square, you
    would set max items to 1. For unlimited items, leave this value blank. This value is also ignored if the "apply to"
    value is set to "order", because in that case the entire cost of the order is used as the basis for the discount.</p>
    <h6 class="bold">Begin Date</h6>
    <p>Allows you to set a date for the promotion to begin. Useful for creating a week long promotion. This field is
    optional. If somebody tries to use the coupon before this date, it will come back as invalid.</p>
    <h6 class="bold">End Date</h6>
    <p>Same behavior as begin date, except controls when the coupon will expire.</p>
