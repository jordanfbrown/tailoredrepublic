    There is no way around it; a black suit needs to be a staple of everybodyâ€™s wardrobe. Things become classics for a
    reason, because they look damn good. A properly tailored black suit will have heads nodding with respect at how well
    you pulled off a classic look. Throw on a peak lapel or make it a three-piece to add a fashionable twist to your
    bread and butter.

    A nice deep navy is the way to go. Sport it during the day with a brown belt and shoes and really let the blue pop.
    As the sun goes down and takes with it the inhibitions of the daytime, you are already rocking a dark suit that can
    take on the nightlife. Two suits in one.

    This is the way to do it right here. Light gray tells people that you know what you are doing with your style game
    and yet can still be worn into the office in the morning. Not to mention that this suit lends itself perfectly to
    accouterments; use that pocket square of yours to wipe off that splash of gin and tonic that did a dance out of your
    glass when you flew through that patch of turbulence.
